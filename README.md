# Fiber Optic Trajectory Optimizing System

## Overview
The Fiber Optic Trajectory Optimizing System is a C++ project designed to optimize fiber optic trajectory planning using various algorithms and data structures. This system is particularly useful for telecommunications and networking professionals who need to efficiently plan and deploy fiber optic networks.

## Features
- **Prim's Algorithm Implementation:** The project includes an implementation of Prim's algorithm for generating Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) on a graph. Prim's algorithm is widely used in network optimization problems and ensures efficient routing of fiber optic cables.
- **Graph Data Structure:** The project utilizes a custom graph data structure to represent the network topology. This data structure enables efficient storage and manipulation of network connectivity information.
- **Login and Signup Functionality:** The system incorporates a secure login and signup mechanism using username-password authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access and utilize the system's features.
- **User-Friendly Console Interface:** The system features a user-friendly console interface that allows users to interact with the application seamlessly. The interface provides intuitive menus and prompts for easy navigation.

## Usage
1. **Login or Signup:** Users can choose to either log in with existing credentials or register for a new account.
2. **Graph Initialization:** The system reads network topology data from an input file and constructs the corresponding graph.
3. **Algorithm Execution:** Users can execute Prim's algorithm to generate an optimized MST for the given network topology.
4. **MST Visualization:** The system provides options to visualize the generated MST, including printing the MST edges and their corresponding weights.
5. **Performance Analysis:** Users can evaluate the performance of the optimized MST by calculating its total weight and analyzing its efficiency in minimizing cable usage.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Fiber Optic Trajectory Optimizing System, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ source code using a compatible compiler.
3. Ensure that the required input files containing network topology data are available.
4. Run the compiled executable file and follow the on-screen instructions to utilize the system's features.
